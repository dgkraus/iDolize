# iDolize

This is my personal learning project. It's a work in progress and actively developed as I continue improving my skills.

## iDolize - Find Your New Favorite Idol!

The main app currently in development is **iDolize**, a small-scale idol database. Users can input parameters, and the app will find their new favorite idol. (Disclaimer: The matching logic is completely arbitrary!)

### **How It Works**
The idol data is sourced using my own scraper, **[iDolscraper](https://github.com/dgkraus/iDolscraper)**. The scraped data is loaded into the database using a custom script.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Python**
- **Django**
- **HTML**
- **Pytest / Playwright** (for testing)

### **What's Next?**
- Docker integration is coming soon
- API implementation via Django REST Framework
- Further testing

Stay tuned for updates!
